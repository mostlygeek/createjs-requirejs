                Demo of various HTML5 sound libraries

                ### Loading
                All library loading are done using [require.js](http://requirejs.org/). In a large
                HTML5 application, like a game, it is important to keep JS source modular. These
                demos serve as an example of how to the different sound libraries even if they 
                don't support [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html) loading.
        
                ### SoundJS + PreloadJS

                Preload and SoundJS are from the CreateJS project and have more production apps
                built with them. 

                * [SoundJS 0.3.0](/sound-js-0.3.0)
                * [SoundJS 0.4.0](/sound-js-0.4.0)
                * [SoundJS NEXT](/sound-js-NEXT) - uses latest code with fixes for Firefox.

                #### Note

                SoundJS 0.4.0 has issues playing multiple channels
                on Firefox (v19). It works as expected in 
                in Chrome and its [WebAudio API](http://bit.ly/Z5dHLz).

                The SoundJS NEXT library is the latest version on the 
                [Github Repo](https://raw.github.com/CreateJS/SoundJS/). It includes
                fixes for the above Firefox `<audio>` issues.

                ### Howler.js

                This demos [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js), a newer HTML5 Audio 
                library that supports the WebAudio API and falls back to `<audio>` tags when necessary.
